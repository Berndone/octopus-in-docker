#+TITLE: Developers notes

Potential points for improvement:

- [[Dockerfile-debian][Dockerfile-debian]] and [[Dockerfile-debian-develop][Dockerfile-debian-develop]] are very similar, and so are
  the ~.github/workflows~.

- We currently build the containers for the architecture on which the job runs.
  It should be possible to host docker images for multiple architectures (in
  particular x86 and the M1/M2 processors) together at Dockerhub.

- We use one particular combination of libraries and flags when compiling
  Octopus. This is not as flexible as using spack, for example. However, those
  flags etc can be adapted if necessary.
